# Inspiring Apps - Code Challenge

## Getting Started
1. In a new browser tab/window, browse to this app's index.html file (or serve it at a known address).
1. Expect: static web page to load

## Notes
* Should work on evergreen browsers that support native ES6 (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
* The Jasmine unit test suite (below) will automatically run on page load.
